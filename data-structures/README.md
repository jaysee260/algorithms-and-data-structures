# Data Structures

An exploration of various data structures and their implementations in JavaScript.

#### What?

Definition of a data structure:

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. ___From [Wikipedia][ds-wiki]___

In other words, we could say that a data structure is like a _container_ in which data is stored and _organized in a particular layout_

#### Why?
Data structures organize data in a particular layout or pattern with the purpose of being efficient in some operations, and less efficient in others.

For instance, a given data structure may be really fast at read operations, while another data structure may be really fast at performing write operations.

Since _data_ is such a crucial entity in computer science, the pursuit to learn and understand data structures (and how to use them) seems well worth the undertaking.

 Our goal is to understand data structures so that we may pick the most optimal data structure(s) for whatever our use-case may be.
