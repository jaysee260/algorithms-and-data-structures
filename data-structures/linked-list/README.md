# Linked Lists

### Definition

A Linked List is a linear collection of data elements called Nodes. In its simplest form, a Node contains _some data_ AND a reference to the next Node in the sequence.

Simply put, a Linked List is a data structure consisting of a group of Nodes that, altogether, represent a sequence; each Node stores a reference or _a link_ to the next Node in the sequence.
