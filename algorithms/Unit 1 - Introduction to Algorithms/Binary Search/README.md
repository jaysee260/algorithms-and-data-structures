# Binary Search

Binary search is a common searching algorithm used to reduce search times.

Its input is a __sorted list__ of elements. If an element you're looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position where that element is located. Otherwise, it will return `null`.


Say you have...
```js
[1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
```
